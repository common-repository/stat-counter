= DB Table maintenance =

Stats Plugin automatically delete older records than 2 days (to have a very short database) and **automaticaly** **optimise** the stat-counter datatable after the removal of olds datas.


== Installation ==
1. Unzip file and Upload "stat-counter" directory in wp-content/plugins/ 
1. Then just activate it on your plugin management page. That's it, you're done! 
1. Note: If you have been using an other compatible StatPress plugin **deactivate it** before enabling stat-counter.
1. If enabling GeoIP support, you must either:
a) use the download button on the "GeoIP" tab of the stat-counter Option Page; or 
b) manually download the database files to your wp-content/GeoIP/ directory. The database files can be found on MaxMind's website:  
* http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz
* http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCountry/GeoIP.dat.gz
You must unzip these file before use with 7-Zip or a similar ZIP program (http://7-zip.org/)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to update the definitions of OS, browsers, spider, search engine of Stats Plugin ? =

it's the same way than the update with StatPress Visitor, see here : 
http://additifstabac.free.fr/index.php/how-to-update-definitions-os-browsers-of-statpress-visitors/

= What is the difference between "visitors Feeds" and "Pageviews feeds"? =

Quite simply, if a single visitor subscribed to RSS feeds on 5 pages of your website, then "Visitors Feeds" is 1 and "Pageviews Feeds" is 5.

= Why "Visitors Feeds" and "pageviews feeds" are not the same account in the "yesterday" and  "Main Overview" pages ? =

This is because the calculations are not the same!
On the "Main Overview", all pages are counted, even those that are automatically generated by WordPress (category, etc.).
On the "Yesterday", only the pages you have actually written and that are stored in your database are taken into account, those generated by WordPress are not counted.
= Isn’t it possible to make it work with network of sites ? =

You can use http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/proper-network-activation/
